About the DataCite Metadata Schema
=====================================


.. note::

   **Citation:** DataCite Metadata Working Group. (2024). DataCite Metadata Schema Documentation for the Publication and Citation of Research Data and Other Research Outputs. Version 4.6. DataCite e.V. https://doi.org/10.14454/mzv1-5b55

   Note that the schema and this documentation will always have the same version number.

   Earlier versions will continue to be available at their previous locations for permanent reference.

`DataCite <https://datacite.org>`_ is a global community that shares a common interest: to ensure that research outputs and resources are openly available and connected so that their reuse can advance knowledge across and between disciplines, now and in the future.

The DataCite Metadata Schema is a list of core metadata properties chosen for accurate and consistent identification of a resource for citation and retrieval purposes, with recommended use instructions in the documentation. The DataCite Metadata Schema is suitable for a wide range of :doc:`resource types </appendices/appendix-1/resourceTypeGeneral>`—from samples and images to data and preprints. (Where the documentation uses the term “data” or “dataset”, this is defined broadly to be inclusive of all research outputs and resources in keeping with `DataCite’s mission <https://www.datacite.org/governance>`_.)  The metadata properties are presented and described in detail in the section :doc:`/properties/index`. 

While DataCite’s Metadata Schema has been expanded with each new version, it is intended to be generic to the broadest range of research outputs and resources, rather than customized to the needs of any particular discipline. DataCite metadata primarily supports citation and discovery of research; it is not intended to supplant or replace the discipline- or community-specific metadata that fully describes the resource and is vital for understanding and reuse.

When registering DOIs with DataCite, community members are strongly encouraged to provide metadata in English whenever possible, in addition to any other language that may be required by the funder or hosting organization. The DataCite Metadata Schema :ref:`supports language attributes for core properties <xmllang>`.
